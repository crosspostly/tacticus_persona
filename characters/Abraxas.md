Until the end of this turn, whenever an enemy unit is dealt Psychic Damage, summon a Screamer of Tzeentch on a free Hex adjacent to Abraxas, preferring hexes adjacent to enemy units. Newly summoned units can immediately attack an enemy in range but cannot move. Split (Pink Horror Passive) When this unit gets defeated it summons 2 Blue Horrors in adjacent Hexes. Does not apply if Overkilled. Newly summoned Blue Horrors can immediately attack an enemy in melee if summoned during the enemy's turn, but cannot move until their next turn. Slashing Dive (Screamer Active) Flies over and deals a wave of damage from an initial melee target to targets up to 2 hexes behind. Deals 1x X Power Damage to the first target, 1x Y Power Damage to the second, and 1x Z Power Damage to the third. Lands in the hex directly behind the last target hit, or - in the case that hex is occupied - to the closest free hex to it.
